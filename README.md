3. Set up a free Twitch Developer app to get a client ID and secret from <https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/>.
4. Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env` and update the variables with your Supabase and Twitch credentials.
5. Run `yarn just update` to start the services, and you're ready to get started! 🚀
